eId="preface__longTitle_1__p_1">To provide a set of regulations governing the use of land and buildings for outdoor advertising and signage and for matters incidental thereto.</p></longTitle></preface><preamble><p eId="preamble__p_1">The object of this By-Law is to regulate outdoor advertising in the jurisdiction of the City of Cape Town in a manner that is sensitive to the environmental quality of different parts of the City of Cape Town. It seeks to strike a balance between outdoor advertising opportunities and economic development on the one hand, and the conservation of visual, tourist, traffic safety, environmental and heritage characteristics on the other hand. The object of this By—Law is to ensure that outdoor advertising respects the integrity of any site on which it is displayed, and complements the character of the locality in which it is displayed.</p><p eId="preamble__p_2">The sensitivity of the proposed locality of a sign and its capacity to withstand the visual impact are the most important guiding principles for the control of outdoor advertising. Outdoor advertising signs should only be placed where they are most compatible with the surrounding locality and where they do not impact on visual corridors and/or scenic drives. Signs that compromise protected, unique or sensitive areas will not be allowed.</p><p eId="preamble__p_3">In addition, outdoor advertising and signs should not compromise the functioning and safety of traffic and should not adversely affect the character of a locality by way of appearance, size or illumination.</p><p eId="preamble__p_4">Advertising on bridges, towers, telecommunication masts or pylons will not be permitted.</p><p eId="preamble__p_5">The types of landscapes, signs and areas of control are important factors in the classification concept utilized in this By-Law. This By-Law presumes that the type of sign gives an indication of the potential impact of such a sign on the locality in which it will be displayed. Thus in terms of this By-Law the local character of an area in which a sign is proposed will affect the degree of control applied in that area.</p><p eId="preamble__p_6">This By-Law recognises that the dynamics between the type of the sign, the sign itself and where it is to be located can most effectively be dealt with by the determination of areas of control. Three areas of control are applied in this By-Law namely maximum, partial and minimum areas of control. The potential for outdoor advertising and the sign types to be considered is therefore determined by permitting certain sign types in certain areas of control. Control measures are applied by means of approval or refusal, and by means of general and specific conditions and requirements.</p><p eId="preamble__p_7">The following signs are outdoor signs but which, without third party advertising, do not constitute outdoor advertising within the ambit of this By-Law:</p><p eId="preamble__p_8">(i) Authorised tourist destination signs as defined by the Roads Traffic Manual</p><p eId="preamble__p_9">(ii) Community information/educational boards</p><p eId="preamble__p_10">(iii) Any sign required to be displayed by law including road traffic signs erected in terms of any Act of Parliament, Provincial Law or By-Law.</p><p eId="preamble__p_11">Finally, this By-Law sets out the procedures to be followed and the criteria used when obtaining approval for a sign applicable to outdoor advertising in the City of Cape Town. In doing so, it recognises that there is an extensive amount of technical detail applicable to specific sign types and their effect in specific localities. The specific requirements for specific signs are set out in the Schedules hereto. The Schedules are part of the By-Law. These Schedules are not any less important than the content of the By-Law itself.</p></preamble><body><part xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/ns/akn/3.0" eId="part_A"><num>A</num><heading>Definitions</heading><content><p eId="part_A__p_1">In this By-law, unless the context otherwise indicates:</p><p eId="part_A__p_2" refersTo="#term-Advertising_structure">"<def refersTo="#term-Advertising_structure">Advertising structure</def>" means any physical structure built or capable of being used to display a sign.</p><p eId="part_A__p_3" refersTo="#term-Advertisement">"<def refersTo="#term-Advertisement">Advertisement</def>" means any representation of a word, name, letter, figure or object or an abbreviation of a word or name, or any symbol; or any light which is not intended solely for illumination or as a warning against any dangers and "advertising" has a similar meaning.</p><p eId="part_A__p_4" refersTo="#term-Aerial_sign">"<def refersTo="#term-Aerial_sign">Aerial sign</def>" means a sign that is displayed or performed in the air, including but not limited to balloons and blimps that can be viewed from within the <term refersTo="#term-Municipality" eId="part_A__p_4__term_1">Municipality</term>’s area of jurisdiction.</p><p eId="part_A__p_5" refersTo="#term-Approval">"<def refersTo="#term-Approval">Approval</def>" means approval by the <term refersTo="#term-Municipality" eId="part_A__p_5__term_1">Municipality</term> or by officials, sub-council’s committees or executive councillors by virtue of powers delegated to them; and "approve" has a corresponding meaning.</p><p eId="part_A__p_6" refersTo="#term-Areas_of_control">"<def refersTo="#term-Areas_of_control">Areas of control</def>" means those areas set out in Schedule 1 of the By-law; and which may be modified and/or amended from time to time, which amendments and modifications will be graphically depicted by way of maps as prepared by the <term refersTo="#term-Municipality" eId="part_A__p_6__term_1">Municipality</term> from time to time.</p><p eId="part_A__p_7" refersTo="#term-Banner">"<def refersTo="#term-Banner">Banner</def>" means any material upon which a sign is displayed in such a manner as to be fully legible in windless conditions, attached to one or more ropes, poles or flagstaffs projecting vertically, horizontally or at an angle, or attached to buildings or special structures, but excludes banners carried as part of a procession.
